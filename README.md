### 👋 Hi there, I'm Muhammed Ansar — Full Stack Developer

I'm a Full Stack Developer with 2 years of hands-on professional experience, currently working at a B2B and B2C product-based startup in Bengaluru. I was part of the core team that built the MVP from the ground up and helped scale it into an enterprise-level system.

🛠️ **Tech Skills**
Primarily skilled in the **MERN stack**, with additional experience in **Flutter** and **Angular** through various company projects. My strong foundation in full stack development comes from completing an intensive 8-month bootcamp at **Brototype**.

🚀 **What I Do**

* Build scalable and meaningful tech solutions
* Take ownership across the stack — frontend, backend, and devops
* Continuously learn and contribute to both personal and community-driven projects
* Explore new tools and frameworks in my spare time to stay sharp

💡 **What Drives Me**
I'm a fast learner, passionate about clean code, performance, and building things that make a difference. Whether it’s shipping features, debugging issues, or experimenting with side projects, I’m always looking for ways to improve and grow.

### 🚀 What I'm Working On

At my current company, I'm playing a key role in building and scaling a SaaS-based mobility platform designed to help taxi and auto-rickshaw drivers across India digitize their services and manage daily operations efficiently.

Some of my key contributions include:

* **Built and scaled full-featured B2B and B2C platforms** from the ground up, including systems for lead generation, booking management, and real-time user interaction.
* **Engineered a complete ride-handling system** with real-time location tracking, odometer and speedometer integration, meter taxi fare logic, and a robust trip booking module with real-time driver–rider updates and communication.
* **Designed and developed dynamic admin dashboards** for both internal and business users to manage users, vehicles, trips, subscriptions, analytics, and real-time alerts.
* **Built high-impact modules** like Trip Share, Open Data Portals, Landing Pages, Admin Panels, an API Documentation Hub, and an SOS emergency system.
* **Architected and maintained scalable backend infrastructure** capable of handling millions of concurrent rides with high uptime and performance.

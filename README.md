### 👋 Hi there, I'm Muhammed Ansar — Full Stack Developer

I'm a Full Stack Developer with 2 years of hands-on professional experience, currently working at a B2B and B2C product-based startup in Bengaluru. I was part of the core team that built the MVP from scratch and helped scale it into an enterprise-level system.

🛠️ **Tech Skills**

Primarily skilled in the **MERN stack**, with additional hands-on involvement in **Flutter** and **Angular** through specific project requirements at my current company.

🚀 **What I Do**

* Build scalable and meaningful tech solutions
* Take ownership across the stack — frontend, backend, and DevOps
* Continuously learn and contribute to personal and community-driven projects
* Explore new tools and frameworks in my spare time to stay sharp

💡 **What Drives Me**
I'm a fast learner, passionate about clean code, performance, and building things that make a difference. Whether it’s shipping features, debugging issues, or experimenting with side projects, I’m always looking for ways to improve and grow.
